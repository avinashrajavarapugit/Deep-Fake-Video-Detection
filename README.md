## üßë‚Äçüíª Key Features  

- **Real-Time Deepfake Detection**: Analyze videos and determine if they are deepfakes.  
- **Audio-Visual Synchronization**: Measure audio-visual alignment for deepfake classification.  
- **Lightweight Dockerized Setup**: Deploy anywhere using Docker.  
- **End-to-End Automation**: Includes preprocessing, feature extraction, and inference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

This project is built using the following technologies:  

- **Programming Languages & Frameworks**:  
  - `Python` (Core logic and ML models)  
  - `Flask` (Backend API)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `NumPy` (Scientific computing)  
  - `TensorFlow` (Deep learning models)  
  - `MoviePy` (Video processing)  
  - `Mediapipe` (Face and landmark detection)  
  - `OpenCV` (Image processing)  
  - `SpeechPy` (Audio feature extraction)  
  - `SciPy` (Signal processing)  
- **Deployment & Containerization**:  
  - `Docker`

## üéØ How It Works  

1. **Video Preprocessing**  
   - Extract frames using OpenCV.  
   - Detect mouth regions with Mediapipe FaceMesh.  

2. **Audio Preprocessing**  
   - Convert video audio to WAV format.  
   - Extract MFCC features using SpeechPy.  

3. **Model Predictions**  
   - Predict audio and video features using pre-trained SyncNet models (`audio_model` and `lip_model`).  
   - Compute Euclidean distance to measure synchronization.  

4. **Deepfake Detection**  
   - Classify video as a deepfake if the synchronization confidence score exceeds a threshold.  


## üì¶ Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.  

### Steps  

1. **Clone the repository**
